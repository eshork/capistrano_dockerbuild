# capistrano_dockerbuild 1.x Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order.

**capistrano_dockerbuild strives to follow [SemVer](http://semver.org)**, similar to the Ruby on Rails project. For a `X.Y.Z` release:

* `Z` indicates bug fixes only; no breaking changes and no new features, except as necessary for security fixes.
* `Y` is bumped when we add new features. Occasionally a `Y` release may include small breaking changes. We will notify via CHANGELOG entries and/or deprecation notices if there are breaking changes.
* `X` is incremented for significant breaking changes. This is reserved for special occasions, like a complete rewrite.

**capistrano_dockerbuild has no current release cadence. That stuff is for adults!** At the moment, this project is a one-man-show. I release stuff when I damn well please, when it pleases me the most. If you don't like that, speak up and become a contributor. If you do that, we can change this line in this file to something less antagonistic.

### More Caveat Emptor: I'm not dedicating any real time here just yet
Until this project becomes more meaningfully maintained, the following update notes will be updated as deemed fit and/or by chance of my mind recognizing documentation significance. If you include this code in your project, your crap may break whenever I happenstantially push things that also makes my own crap break. I'll probably be working to fix it soon'ish, but also maybe I'll spend the weekend eating tacos and sleeping instead. The risk is all yours.


# Update notes

## [`1.1.3`] (2018-07-16)
Removes a bunch of things left over from debugging. Some cause real issues with deploys. This probably won't be the last.
